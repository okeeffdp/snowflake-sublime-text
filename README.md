## Description

Thanks for using this extension. If you have any issues you can report them via github. If you'd like to support development on this my donation links are at the bottom.

The aim of this extension is the give a more accurate syntax highlighting for Snowflake SQL flavour used in the Snowlfake data warehouse. It colours keywords such as `IFF` to distinguish them from other database flavours of SQL, like Hive or Presto, so that code is more readible.

The plugin automatically activates Snowflake syntax highlighting for extensions:

 * .snowql

Happy coding!
